In the book, David tries to figure out concepts that prooved successful in the last
decades of Software Development and thus could help to move our business from
a craft to a serious engineering discipline.
He sorts those concepts by two main goals "Optimize for Learning" and
"Optimize for Managing Complexity".
The resulting groups, which are also the chapters of the main part of the book are:

- for Learning:
  - Working Iteratively
  - Feedback
  - Incrementalism
  - Empiricism
  - Being Experimental
- for Managing Complexity:
  - Modularity
  - Cohesion
  - Separation of Concerns
  - Information Hiding and Abstraction
  - Managing Coupling

While none of those concepts are new, it is the first time I saw them put into
context like this and also backed up with good arguments as well as some data.

The book then ends with giving some tools to improve the above concepts:

- Test-Driven Development
- Ensuring Deployability
- and Speed: He recommends a maximum of five minutes from commit to test results
  and one hour from commit to deployment.

Even though the read was a bit repetitive since there is some overlap between
the different topics, I found it very inspiring and motivating to try out the
presented ideas.
