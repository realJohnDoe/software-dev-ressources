For example tests that\nonly test mocks and no acutal code.</li>\n<li>Large Acceptance Tests are often red for a significant amount of time, without\nthe devs knowing if they are broken, due to unimplemented features or due to\nbugs.\n=> Developers started ignoring them and did not want to write them.\nThis not changing even after a long time, is also a warning sign.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3

alright, maybe we overloaded the\nconcept with other, less helpful concepts.\nIt already has answers for many issues we face with TDD today.\nFor examples:\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avoid testing implementation details, test behaviors</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>=> Focus on testing the public API, i.e.\n<ul>\n<li>the \"exports\" from a module</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The system under test is not a class</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The SUT is the \"exports\" from a module</li>\n<li>The old \"unit\" means a module, not a \"class\"</li>\n<li>Refactoring is a key step to distinguish stuff implementation details and\nstable interfaces, \"behaviors\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>Definition of unit is how the product can be separated so it can be tested in\nparallel.\n<ul>\n<li>Accessing the file system or a database is bad because it makes the tests\nless independent, and it improves speed.\nIf both are no issue, it is okay to access external systems during testing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"73neeqm706h4yfbgcigd5bv","title":"Software Development
