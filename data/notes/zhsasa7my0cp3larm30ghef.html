<ul>
<li>Staying for longer than 2 years makes it possible to learn from mistakes that
you would otherwise not have noticed.</li>
<li>Having much more test code than implementation seems a bit weird.</li>
<li>Tests with many mocks tend to break when refactoring, which seems wrong.
Changing the implementation details should not require the tests to change.</li>
<li>"Programmer Anarchy" is about developing products with only developers.</li>
<li>Tests whose intent is unclear should be a warning sign. For example tests that
only test mocks and no acutal code.</li>
<li>Large Acceptance Tests are often red for a significant amount of time, without
the devs knowing if they are broken, due to unimplemented features or due to
bugs.
=> Developers started ignoring them and did not want to write them.
This not changing even after a long time, is also a warning sign.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"Test-Driven Development" by Kent Beck seems alright, maybe we overloaded the
concept with other, less helpful concepts.
It already has answers for many issues we face with TDD today.
For examples:
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid testing implementation details, test behaviors</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>=> Focus on testing the public API, i.e.
<ul>
<li>the "exports" from a module</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The system under test is not a class</p>
<ul>
<li>The SUT is the "exports" from a module</li>
<li>The old "unit" means a module, not a "class"</li>
<li>Refactoring is a key step to distinguish stuff implementation details and
stable interfaces, "behaviors"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Definition of unit is how the product can be separated so it can be tested in
parallel.
<ul>
<li>Accessing the file system or a database is bad because it makes the tests
less independent, and it improves speed.
If both are no issue, it is okay to access external systems during testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
